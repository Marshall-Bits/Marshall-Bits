### Marshall-Bits Github profile

## Hi!🖖 I'm  Marcel, musician 🎸 and developer 💻 

I am a full-time developer and part-time teacher assistant. I have a passion for web development and started my journey in 2020 with JavaScript. I have since completed two web development bootcamps and have gained valuable skills and knowledge in the field.

In the past, I have also had experience creating websites for non-profit organizations using HTML and exploring the possibilities of Macromedia Flash for animations and UI design.

I am also an avid learner and share my progress and experiences with Game Development using Unity and C# on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-nOGxd9XkmoztFolVupiAQ) in Spanish. I am excited to continue growing and developing my skills as a developer and to contribute to meaningful projects.
