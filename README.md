## Hi!🖖 I'm  Marcel, software developer and instructor 💻 

### 👶 First Steps
My first memory of using a computer was with MS-DOS when I was 5 years old. My father taught me how to use the terminal to install games and programs. Do you remember the first Prince of Persia games? From there, my curiosity about technology has never stopped growing.

### 🎮 My First Games and Websites
By the age of 15, I had already spent a long time tinkering with game scripts. I watched how DOOM mods were created and wondered how they were made, what all those text files or .bat files were for. I started studying HTML on my own and Flash, and that's how my first web pages and games came about. Don't think I made a game as good as DOOM 😅, they were more like flash games for dressing up dolls, making puzzles, point-and-click games, and things like that. And my pages were more like Homer Simpson's, until I got my first serious client.

### 🎓 Education
My education was very self-taught until I decided to do a bootcamp to update my knowledge and learn the technologies in demand. Not content with that, I did another free bootcamp for web development, in addition to countless Udemy courses. By that time, I was already uploading videos to YouTube showing what I was learning in game development. I also realized how rewarding it was to teach and share knowledge while collaborating on projects with my peers, so I decided to apply for a teaching position.

### 🚀 Present Day
Today, I have given more than 4000 hours of courses and trained thousands of students both in-person and remotely, as a teacher in 3 different academies and Udemy. Realizing that my students value my work and seeing success stories fills me with pride and motivates me to keep learning and teaching. I hope you enjoy my courses and that they help you achieve your goals as well.
