## Hi!🖖 I'm  Marcel, musician 🎸 and developer 💻 

🎵 Creativity and Technology

As a musician and developer, I love merging creative expression with technical innovation. Always seeking opportunities to learn and grow.

🚀 Journey

I created my first website at the age of 15, with the help of a web development manual I found on my father's bookshelf. My first website was worse than Homer Simpson's, but soon I started exploring new options like Dreamweaver and Flash (yes, I'm that old 🥸). It was a hobby for me until I had the opportunity to dedicate myself to it, acquire new knowledge, and gain the momentum to fully immerse myself in the tech industry. Through two bootcamps and countless YouTube videos and online courses, I was able to steer myself toward what is now my passion and profession.

👨‍🏫 Lead Teacher at Ironhack
